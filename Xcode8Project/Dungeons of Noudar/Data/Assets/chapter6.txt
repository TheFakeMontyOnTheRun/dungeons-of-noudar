- Under the sheltering mercy  -
May the coat of pride clouding your
horizons have faded with your scars.

Only by standing in the shoes of any
giving soul you can experience the joy
of this uplifting gesture.

In this fiery will lies the utmost
chance to grant the eternal penitent
another chance for redemption. At least
until it's next trial.

Even your existance must have a reason.
