- Dungeon of despair -
The poisonous seeds can only grow if
fed with the most slovenly of the
living souls.

Even the most resilient flame require
fanning to thrust new life into these
cold walls. The cry from the damned
drips from between the moldy bricks.

Whispers and howls defy your bravery,
but also pull you further into it's
nurturing womb.
May fire consume this scourge.
