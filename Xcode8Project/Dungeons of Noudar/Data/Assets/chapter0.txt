- The Citadel -
You, a former priest and crusader, were
summoned to investigate and ultimately
perform the ancient pagan rituals
required to purge the sacred citadel
from once again falling into demoniac
hands.

Like the ones that came before you,
generation after generation, you will
have to assess the situation and
preserve your own faith.

This holy land is at your hands now.
