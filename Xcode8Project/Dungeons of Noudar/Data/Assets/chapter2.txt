- Prison -
The situation is much worse then your
biggest fears and the more you look,
the less you expect to find a solution.

There is, it seems, a source to all
this tainted web of befallen counter
measures. It must be somewhere in here.

In previous times, a guardian would
personally hand over the token of it's
faith and finish it's pupil training,
but your journey here and your pagan
roots are your only tool now.
