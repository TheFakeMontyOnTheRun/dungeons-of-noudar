                        - Epilogue -
                    After such gruesome
                    and soul-searching
                    battle, you did it.
                    The demon is gone.

                    You barely had time
                    to breathe as the
                    ground began to
                    rumble. A split 
                    second later,
                    anything beneath 
                    you simply 
                    collapsed into a 
                    big amorphous plot 
                    of land.

                    Finally peace and 
                    redemption savory.
                    Embrace eternity.

                    Thanks for playing!
