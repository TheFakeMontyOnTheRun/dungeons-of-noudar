- Monastery -
The sudden realization that you might
be late brings tears into your eyes and
fear into your heart.

In other times, your faith would be on
trial. What's left of it, after so many
years doesn't feel threatened, but
rather vindicated.

You expected the priests, but not a
soldier to be present. Something more
lies beath this. You have to seek the
fate of this congregation's leadership.
