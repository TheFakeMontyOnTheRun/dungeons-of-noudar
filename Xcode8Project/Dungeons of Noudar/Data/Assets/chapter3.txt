- Graveyard -
As you gazed into the eternal lava, new
perspectives hit fathoms deep into the
core of your presumedly failed creed.

If that crossbow, such icon of hope,
stood by the well unscathed, so will
the pure shimmering strength you have
in store for such dark forces.

From afar, you could see the temple of
such perversions - so close you could
almost hear it's whisper. There must be
a new route for your new crusade.
