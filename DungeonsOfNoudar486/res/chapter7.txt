- Epilogue -
After such gruesome and soul-searching
battle, you did it. The demon is gone.

You barely had time to breathe as the
ground began to rumble. A split second
later, anything beneath you simply
collapsed into a big amorphous plot of
land.

Finally peace and redemption found you.
Embrace eternity.

Thank you for playing.
